# :basketball: nba-sql

An application to build a Postgres or MySQL NBA database from the public API.

This DB is still under construction and liable to schema changes. v1 will be a postgres dump file and will be included in the release. Until then, expect to rebuild the whole DB when trying to upgrade.

The default behavior is collecting seasons 1996-97 to 2020-21 and inserting them into a MySQL database. There are flags provided to change to a Postgres database, and to specify a specific season.

Big shoutout to BurntSushi's (nbadb)[https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb]. It was a great inspiration to this project.

[A good place for more information is the wiki](https://github.com/mpope9/nba-sql/wiki).

The following environment variables must be set. There are no commandline arguments to specify these. The following example are connection details for the provided docker-compose database:
```
DB_NAME="nba"
DB_HOST="localhost"
DB_USER="nba_sql"
DB_PASSWORD="nba_sql"
```

Here is an example query. Lets say we want to find Russell Westbrook's total Triple-Doubles:
```
SELECT SUM(td3) 
FROM player_game_log 
LEFT JOIN player ON player.player_id = player_game_log.player_id 
WHERE player.player_name = 'Russell Westbrook';
```

## :wrench: Building From Scratch

Requirements:

Python >= 3.6

### :scroll: Provided Scripts

In the `scripts` directory, we provide a way to create the schema and load the data for a Postgres database. We also provide a docker-compose setup for development and to preview the data.

```shell
# Required if you're on Debian based systems
sudo service postgresql stop
docker-compose up -d

pip install -r requirements.txt

./scripts/create_postgres.sh
```

### :snake: Directly Calling Python

The entrypoint is `stats/nba_sql.py`. To see the available arguments, you can use:
```bash
python stats/nba_sql.py -h
```

To create the schema, use the `--create_schema`. Example:
```bash
pyhton stats/nba_sql.py --create_schema=True
```

To enable a Postgres database, use the `--database` flag. Example:
```bash
python stats/nba_sql.py --database="postgres"
```

We have added a half second delay between making requests to the NBA stats API. To configure the amount of time use the `--time_between_requests` flag.
```bash
python stats/nba_sql.py --time_between_requests=.5
```

### :computer: Local development

##### The manual way
Create your virtual environment if you don’t have one already. In this case we use `venv` as the target folder for storing packages.

`python -m venv venv`

Then activate it:
`source venv/bin/activate`

Install dependencies using:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
